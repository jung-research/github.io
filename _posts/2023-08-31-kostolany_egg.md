**달걀 모형**은 「앙드레 코스톨라니[^1]」가 평생 동안 실전 투자를 통해 배우고 느낀 점을 이론화 시킸다

주식시장에 국한된 이론이 아니라 경제 전반에 걸쳐 금리에 따라 투자 대상이 어떻게 변하는지를 설명한다

달걀 모형에 따르면 크게 은행예금, 채권, 부동산, 주식등 4가지의 투자 대상이 있는데, 금리의 변화에 투자자들이 선호하는
투자대상이 달라지며 돈의 흐름을 이해할 수 있게 된다

    A1 = Stock price correction; low volume, low number of stock owners 
    A2 = Increasing stock prices; volume and number of stock owners are increasing 
    A3 = Bubble prices; high volumes, high number of stock owners 
    
    B1 = Stock price correction; low volume, number of stock owners are slowly decreasing 
    B2 = Decreasing stock prices; volume and number of stock owners are decreasing further 
    B3 = Market crash prices; high volumes, low number of stock owners 

We should buy during A1 and B3, hold our stock/money during A2 and B2, and sell during A3 and B1.

Kostolany also in his book also says, when everybody (taxi driver, cleaner etc) around him owns stocks (X) that is the sign for him to sell, 
and when nobody owns any stocks (Y) that is the sign to buy. So according to his theory the investor should watch the volume of retail investors 
stock trading and the general enthusiasm for stocks
